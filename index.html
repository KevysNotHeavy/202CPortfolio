    <p class="Indent">I am an EMET (Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology) student at Penn State New Ken. I am always looking for new ways to create and am interested in hearing how things work and the modern discoveries we are unfacing about life, death, engineering, science, computer science, etc.</p>

    <p class="Indent">My Mission is to help where I can and help fuel the future of engineering, as well as creativity and innovation in general. My vision is to have a clean world, thriving economy, and a better quality of life for the world, animals, and people around us, while still moving humanity forward.</p>

    <p>I hope that if you are seeing this, you have the same vision as me. Bless you all and have a great day.</p>
