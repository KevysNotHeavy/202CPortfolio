    <h1>Digital Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
    
    <p>Hello! My name is Evan Yackuboskey. I am an EMET (Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology) Major at Penn State. I am currently a Sophmore as of Spring 2025 and am on course to graduate in Spring 2027. During my time in my technical writing course, I have gotten experience with varying forms of writing and have become more aware of areas of focus in writing like audience and tone. Below, my resume and a few practice techincal documents can be viewed.</p>
    
    <p>This entire webpage was formatted and written entirely in html and css (which I am actively refreshing myself on as we speak). I have always had a great interest in programming, electronics, engineering and anything creative or wonderous. I am quick to learn and adapt and always willing to help or work with others.</p>
